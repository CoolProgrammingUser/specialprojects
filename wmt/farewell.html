			<section>
				You likely have noticed that I don't tend to talk much about topics unrelated to work, and as a result, people are left with a bunch of mysteries about me and even more wild assumptions. As my parting gift to you, I'll let you in on the secret life of Robert, and while I'm at it, I'll say the goodbyes that I've been either too embarassed to say or too busy to say. Don't use reading this as an excuse to slack off at work, but I hope you can find the time to look this over.
			</section>
			<section>
				Skipping over the less relevant stuff (sorry), my family moved around a little bit, but we ended up in Pacific, Missouri where I went to high school and am going back to after leaving Walmart. Due to a variety of factors, not least of which is a general lack of preparation for the college application process, I spent a year at Boston University, but due to the expenses and other factors, I spent the next three years at SEMO. During that time, I restarted and ran a biology club, and separately, after a fairly long period of friendship, I started going out with my girlfriend, Linda.
			</section>
			<section>
				Like in any relationship, Linda and I had our ups and downs, but things got particularly rough after the pandemic shut down SEMO after spring break of my last semester there. Aside from the previous winter break, that was the first time we had gone more than a day or two without seeing each other, and Linda does not handle separation well at all. As luck would have it, Linda actually also lived in Pacific, which you would think would solve everything, but at the time, I didn't have a car or insurance (although I did have a license), so Linda or my parents would have to make all of the trips between our houses, and Linda quickly became cynical of the chore. Not only did she not like driving and feel like I should be the one picking her up because I'm "the guy" (along with her parents), but she also very much disliked associating with my parents for a number of reasons including how the cigarette smoke and pet dander would give her a rash and how my dad is just an extremely difficult person to get along with. I was barely keeping up with my schoolwork, especially in between all of the projects my dad was having me help him with, so getting a job wasn't really feasible for me until after online school was over, but that didn't comfort Linda in the least. We almost broke up on numerous occasions, but I have a way with words that sometimes surprises even me, and we kept trying to work through things. Eventually, school did end, and I tried to find a biology job. (I wanted to go to graduate school, but I had missed most application deadlines, and there was a very strong pressure for me to find a job.) Knowing Linda still had a semester of college left, I pretty much exclusively looked for jobs in Cape Girardeau, especially since that would allow me to move out of my parents' house. Of the places I was able to apply to in between an increased effort by my dad to get me to help him on his projects (now that school didn't occupy any time), no biology job wanted me, but I was insistently urged to get any job at all. Linda started helping me submit my application, and although I tried to get at least a technology job (which I felt would be a moderately acceptable downgrade from a biology job), she applied me all over the place. With the standards greatly reduced, a few places expressed slight interest in my application, but the only one that didn't fall through (including an application to the Cape Girardeau supercenter Walmart) was the application to the neighborhood market Walmart which Linda just so happened to have started working at. By that time, I ended up with a car and insurance, and so once everything was in place, I moved in with Linda and started working at Walmart.
			</section>
			<section>
				As you can imagine, I didn't have the greatest mindset coming into the job: Even though I felt like I was a pretty employable person and thought I did a decent job of expressing that on my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, the only place that would take me is a place where Linda could put in a good word for me. Moreover, Walmart is depicted as the absolute lowest place to get a job, and it doesn't feel good to get a biology degree only to work at a place that will take high school drop-outs. Prior to Walmart, the only real job experience I had was a work-study job at Boston University, so that could've been a factor, but I didn't understand how even other entry level jobs didn't want me (also, there's entry level biology jobs, too). I put my best foot forward when doing my job, but I was feeling pretty worthless.
			</section>
			<section>
				The fun didn't stop there, though. One thing that has been a major problem throughout my life is getting things done in a timely fashion. Most easily observable in school, I can be more that capable of doing something, and I can even devote a large amount of uninterrupted time to work on it, but I still might not be able to finish whatever it is. In class, people would often ask me for help on things because they knew I had a solid understanding of the material, and they would debate whether I had a 98% in the class or a 100%, but in reality, I'd sometimes be bordering on a D because I just couldn't keep up with the homework. It was after I failed two classes one semester in college that I pursued (and got) a diagnosis of ADD. When it came to picking at Walmart my speed was no better. Everyone was very reluctant to talk about pick rates with me, and this was before everyone could see how they're doing on My Store, but after starting to keep track of my pick walks on Dallas' advice, I could see that I was averaging something on the order of 50-60 items an hour even after working full-time for over a month. Considering how I wasn't anywhere near the required 100 items an hour, I wasn't too optimistic about my future at Walmart. There's a possibility that I could've presented my ADD diagnosis to management and gotten accomodations, but I don't like special treatment, and I don't think anyone could've really done anything besides just accept lower-quality work from me. I did, however, restart my pursuit of a medication that might help (although that didn't get me very far). I had gotten to the point where I was fully expecting to get fired, and I was just hoping that it could be postponed long enough for me to get another job.
			</section>
			<section>
				Meanwhile, I had a lot riding on my job, so I wasn't very eager to get fired. Foremost of the things riding on my job was my ability to continue a relationship with Linda. Because of my lack of work experience and difficulties getting things done, Linda wasn't very convinced that I'd be able to hold a job, and that was pretty much a dealbreaker for her. Even if that wasn't a dealbreaker, though, we still surely would've broken up if I got fired because I would've had to go back home because she wasn't going to let me actually live with her without a steady source of income, and I already told you how she can't even do a sort-distance relationship. For the first month or so of me living here, the only things not stored in my car were little more than my backpack and a pile of clothes on the closet floor because Linda wouldn't add me to the apartment lease until I showed I could keep my job, and until then, it had to be possible to hide that I was living there. I also had to park in one of the visitors' parking spots which were quite a distance from the apartment. Other problems of losing my job were how I wasn't particularly a fan of living with my parents and how I wouldn't have a way of paying back my student loans when the time came. I would've liked to have confided in someone with this mountain of problems, but between working and giving Linda the attention she needed, I had essentially no time for anything else, and I lost contact with basically all of my friends. Also, it's not like I could talk about my problems with Linda because she was already waiting for a sign that I can't keep my life held together. As a result, I learned to just internalize all of my stress and try to find some way of muddling forward on my own.
			</section>
			<section>
				Much to my relief, it turned out that I could keep up with dispensing, and once Dallas figured that out, she made sure that I was doing that basically all the time. Slowly, I began to feel more secure in my job, and a large weight was lifted off of my shoulders. Ironically enough, after dispensing for a few months, it turns out that my pick rate dramatically increased to an acceptable level. In case you're wondering, though, none of this has anything to do with any ADD medication I may have been taking. Although I tried some things, the doctor who can prescribe the stuff is ridiculously difficult to get a hold of, and the trial period each time is a month, so it's very slow-going, and the most I ever noticed was a slight increase in my energy level on occasion. One day, while I was dispensing during a rush with more energy than a certain person thought I should have, they rhetorically asked whether I was on Adderal. As it just so happened, I'm pretty sure I legitimately was on Adderal at the time, but it's worth noting that people have commented on my energy level even when I wasn't taking any medication.
			</section>
			<section>
				I could tell you about my various misadventures at work, but most people are familiar with those or don't want to be reminded of similar things that happened to them, so I'm going to address things that you surely don't know. In particular, I should've been fired a long time ago. Just to be clear, this isn't about my inability to pick quickly (which Dallas repeatedly insisted that we could find a way around); it's about attendance points. Going along with my difficulties in doing things quickly, I also have difficulties transitioning between things and getting places on time. Because of the obscure rules in place during the pandemic, I was never totally sure when I was coming in late in the beginning of my time at Walmart, and it would only ever be by a few minutes (which no one would notice), but it added up pretty quickly. One day, Dallas came to me and said that I needed to be more forceful with getting people to take my temperature in the morning because it was making me late. Apparently, my points had been getting forgiven because people were watching the cameras and seeing me in the store when I should be. It was beyond me how anyone could look at timestamped video footage of my entry into the store and come to the conclusion that the temperature check was the thing making me late, but I didn't have it in me to point out that I'm actually just a disappointment. Thankful for the mistake, I resolved to be more on top of my attendance, but it was only a matter of time before I started slipping up again. At one point, I was told that I had reached the number of points requiring my termination, but because I had PPTO, I could make up for just enough of them (after I was shown how to put it in). After I knew how to put in PPTO to cover the times I was late, I stopped accumulating points (which allowed me to get rid of all of my points just recently), but I still should've run out of PPTO by now with how much I've used it over time. I've contemplated why I never seem to lose any PPTO despite the frequency with which I put it in, and I've come up with some theories such as strange policies regarding the coronavirus or not making much sense because of all of the overtime I've been getting, but I've never really wanted to know because I've been worried about abusing that knowledge. The persistence of this problem has lead me to cry on my way work quite a few times. This, coupled with problems I may be having with Linda, probably resulted in an average of crying in my car every few days or so. It was quite rare that anyone noticed much, though, because I'd usually be okay enough by the time I started working that people didn't think much of it. For the record, the reason I almost always take long breaks and lunches isn't because I'm reluctant to go back to work or am trying to make up for some of my overtime; it's typically because I have a hard time going from one thing to the next, so it takes extra time for me to make the transition. It's because of my struggle with doing things on time that I've always had a special sympathy for people who get fired because of points (which is just about everyone who gets fired). Although I suspect it's largely something she tells herself to feel better about something she has to do regardless, Dallas typically falls back on the justification that even good workers need to be fired if they "don't show up to work"; however, from strictly a points perspective, it could be said that I fall into that category even though I've never missed a day of work. I can't help but contemplate how many good workers have been lost because they haven't been as lucky as me.
			</section>
			<section>
				When it comes to my life with Linda, there's a number of things I could talk about, but I think more recent events are the most noteworthy. After a period of applying and then evaluating her options, Linda set things up to go to a pharmacy school in Arkansas. Naturally, being her boyfriend and having no strong ties to this particular location, I planned on going with her. I set my last day of work to mesh with our plans of moving, and I slowly let people know why I'm leaving. However, about a month ago, Linda told me how she didn't think I should go with her to Arkansas because she didn't think she was ever going to marry me. This wasn't as initially crushing as you might otherwise think because I had been holding in a lot of issues that I was too scared to talk with her about because I could never tell when a problem would be one in which Linda would shut down and make things worse or one in which she would respond to calmly and work with me to find a solution. We talked things over, and I contemplated the possibility that I'd be able to turn things around like I had done so many times before, but as time went by, it became clear that there was no longer any future for our relationship. Within a few days of me coming to this realization, we all had a meeting at work to hammer out some of the problems our department had been having lately. Among other things, Dallas talked about how we need to communicate with each other, and she picked me out to make her point by asking me whether my girlfriend and I communicated and whether things would work if we didn't. I nearly burst into tears right in front of everyone at that moment because, although it's debatable whether it would've changed the end result, there had been a large communication problem between Linda and me which certainly didn't help the underlying problems.
